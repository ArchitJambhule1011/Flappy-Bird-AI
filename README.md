# Flappy-Bird-AI
Using NEAT genetic algorithm to teach neural networks to play Flappy Bird game

# Instructions
This project is a Python implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, the neural networks are trained to play Flappy Bird by learning how to navigate through pipes without colliding with them. 

To run the project, you need a configuration file for NEAT that specifies the parameters for the algorithm.
Simply run the Project_1_Flappy_bird.py script and pass in the path to the configuration file as an argument.
The script will then train the neural networks using NEAT and display a window showing the progress of the generations as the AI attempts to play the game
